You are given 2 files,
the is the client code and a PCAP file 
This pcap file contains the communication with the server, and somehow, among all that trffic,
the client receives the flag from the server Sadly the server is NO LONGER RUNNING  as someone spilled some Monster on it because the thougth it would make it run faster,
so the PCAP file and the clinet is all we have go off,
GOOD LUCK.
